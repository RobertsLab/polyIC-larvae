## 2. Conditioning/Priming Procedures

### 2.1 PolyIC Treatment Protocol

**Treatment Agent**: Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyIC) - a synthetic double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection and stimulates immune response without causing actual pathogen exposure.

**Broodstock Treatment**:
- **Treatment group**: Adult breeding oysters immersed in PolyIC solution for 2 hours
- **Control group**: Adult oysters maintained under standard conditions without PolyIC exposure
- **Timing**: Treatment administered immediately before spawning to maximize potential for transgenerational effects
- **Replication**: Approximately equal numbers of parents contributed to each pooled treatment group

**Spawning Protocol**:
- Oysters spawned at Point Whitney using standard production workflow
- Pooled egg and sperm collected separately from Control and Treated broodstock
- Fertilization conducted independently for each treatment group
- Equal contribution from multiple parents per treatment to maintain genetic diversity

### 2.2 Reproducibility Information

To reproduce this conditioning protocol:
1. Select healthy broodstock oysters at reproductive maturity
2. Divide into two groups (Control and Treated) with equal sample sizes
3. Prepare PolyIC solution according to manufacturer specifications
4. Immerse treated group in PolyIC solution for exactly 2 hours
5. Maintain control group under identical conditions without PolyIC
6. Following treatment, immediately spawn both groups using standard hatchery protocols
7. Fertilize eggs with sperm from same treatment group (avoid cross-contamination)
8. Pool gametes from multiple individuals within each treatment for genetic diversity

- Some tags (017, 019, 020) showed larger average sizes, possibly indicating favorable microhabitat conditions

### 4.2 Survival Under Temperature Stress

#### Experimental Design
- Acute temperature stress tests conducted on juvenile oysters (January-March 2025)
- Oysters exposed to range of temperatures for 24 hours
- Mortality scored at 0h, 5h, and 24h post-exposure

#### Temperature-Dependent Mortality Patterns

**Statistical Model**: Generalized linear mixed model with binomial distribution
- Response: Mortality (0 = alive, 1 = dead)
- Fixed effects: Temperature × Treatment × Hours
- Random effects: Tank and Treatment:Tank
- Significant main effects: Temperature (p < 0.0001), Treatment (p = 0.01), Hours (p < 0.0001)
- Marginal interaction: Temperature × Treatment (p = 0.068)

**Key Findings by Temperature**:

*Low-Moderate Temperatures (16-21°C)*:
- Minimal mortality in both groups (<5%)
- No consistent differences between control and treated offspring
- Both groups tolerated baseline temperatures well

*Moderate-High Temperatures (36-38°C)*:
- **Treatment effects emerge**
- At 36°C: 25% mortality in treated group (3 out of 12 oysters), 0% in control group
- Treated offspring showed higher susceptibility at this critical temperature threshold

*High Temperatures (40-42°C)*:
- **Reversal of treatment effect**
- At 40°C: Control group showed HIGHER mortality than treated group
- At 42°C: Treated group showed higher mortality than control at 24h time point
- Complex, time-dependent mortality patterns

*Extreme Temperatures (45°C)*:
- High mortality in both groups
- Treatment differences become less pronounced at lethal temperatures

**Interpretation**:
- Parental PolyIC treatment creates **temperature-specific survival trade-offs**
- Treated offspring may be more vulnerable at moderate heat stress (36°C)
- Treated offspring may perform better at higher temperatures (40°C)
- Effects are not uniformly beneficial or detrimental but context-dependent

### 4.3 Metabolic Activity

#### Resazurin Assay Results

**Method**: Resazurin (alamarBlue) reduction measured as proxy for cellular metabolic rate
- Higher fluorescence = higher metabolic activity
- Assays conducted across temperature gradient

**Key Findings**:

*Baseline Metabolic Rates (Control Temperature)*:
- **Treated offspring showed elevated metabolic activity** compared to controls
- Difference consistent across early measurements
- Suggests constitutively higher cellular metabolic demand in treated group

*Temperature-Dependent Responses*:
- Both groups showed increased metabolism with increasing temperature
- **Treatment × Temperature interaction observed**
- Rate of metabolic increase differed between groups as temperature rose

*Time Course Analysis*:
- Metabolic rates measured over 4-6 hour incubations
- Treated group maintained higher activity levels throughout time course
- Pattern consistent across multiple experimental batches

**Biological Interpretation**:
- Higher metabolic rates in treated offspring may indicate:
  - Enhanced cellular activity and growth potential
  - Increased energetic costs (metabolic trade-off)
  - Primed immune/stress response systems requiring energy
- Connection to growth: Higher metabolism may contribute to observed growth advantages
- Connection to survival: Higher metabolic costs may create vulnerability under specific stress conditions (e.g., 36°C mortality)

### 4.4 Survival Rates Through Development

**Larval Stage Survival** (0-14 days):
- **Days 0-3**: Not quantified precisely, but standard hatchery performance
- **Days 3-8**: >90% survival in all larval groups (both treatments)
- **Days 8-14**: >95% survival in all larval groups (both treatments)
- **No treatment effect on larval survival** under optimal rearing conditions

**Setting Success** (Metamorphosis):
- **Both treatments**: >20-25% setting rate in Kona facility
- No apparent treatment effect on competency or settlement
- Setting rates considered high for commercial standards

**Juvenile Survival** (Post-setting):
- Maintained in upwellers with periodic monitoring
- No mass mortality events reported
- Sufficient survival for all experimental assays and outplants

**Key Insight**: Parental treatment did not negatively impact survival under optimal conditions, but created differential responses under stress conditions as described in Section 4.2.

## 8. Conclusions

### 8.1 Main Findings

1. **Transgenerational immune priming is effective**: Parental PolyIC treatment produces lasting effects in offspring detectable through juvenile stages (8+ months post-fertilization).

2. **Growth enhancement observed**: Treated offspring showed 43% greater average size, with significant differences at 93 and 236 days of age.

3. **Temperature-dependent survival trade-offs**: Treatment created complex, temperature-specific effects on survival. Benefits at some temperatures (40°C) were offset by costs at others (36°C).

4. **Elevated metabolic activity**: Treated offspring exhibited higher baseline metabolic rates, potentially explaining both enhanced growth and increased stress vulnerability.

5. **No universal advantage**: Effects are environmentally contingent. Optimal strategy depends on expected deployment conditions.

### 8.2 Aquaculture Implications

**Positive aspects**:
- Enhanced growth could reduce time to market size
- Better performance under specific thermal regimes
- No negative effects under optimal hatchery conditions

**Considerations**:
- Need to match primed oysters to appropriate grow-out environments
- Potential for reduced performance at specific temperature thresholds
- Higher metabolic costs may require increased feeding

**Recommendations for application**:
- Consider thermal profile of deployment site when selecting conditioning strategy
- For sites with frequent 36-38°C exposures: standard (unprimed) oysters may perform better
- For sites with rapid growth potential and moderate stress: primed oysters may excel
- Monitor performance across multiple environmental contexts before large-scale implementation

### 8.3 Future Directions

1. **Mechanistic studies**: Investigate molecular basis of transgenerational effects through RNA-seq analysis
2. **Longer-term monitoring**: Track performance through full grow-out cycle to market size
3. **Additional stressors**: Test effects under disease challenge, hypoxia, and other relevant stressors
4. **Optimization**: Refine PolyIC dose and timing to maximize benefits while minimizing trade-offs
5. **Multi-generational tracking**: Determine if effects persist beyond F1 generation
