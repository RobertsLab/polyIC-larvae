# Revision Summary - All Oysters Analysis

## What Changed
- **Previous Analysis**: Limited to top 30 largest oysters per image
- **Revised Analysis**: Measures ALL detected oysters in each image

## Results Comparison

### Before (Top 30 Only)
- Total oysters: 240 (30 per image)
- Average length: 20.61 mm
- Average width: 13.51 mm

### After (All Oysters)
- Total oysters: 1,007 (varies by image)
- Average length: 14.53 mm
- Average width: 8.62 mm

## Why the Difference?
The previous analysis only measured the 30 largest oysters per image, which were naturally larger specimens. By measuring all oysters, we now include smaller individuals, resulting in:

1. **Lower average measurements** - More representative of the entire population
2. **Higher total count** - Better statistical power for analysis
3. **More accurate size distribution** - Includes the full range of oyster sizes

## Oyster Counts by Tag
| Tag | Count | Previous Count |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| 013 | 124   | 30             |
| 014 | 112   | 30             |
| 015 | 116   | 30             |
| 016 | 125   | 30             |
| 017 | 134   | 30             |
| 018 | 130   | 30             |
| 019 | 135   | 30             |
| 020 | 131   | 30             |

## Benefits of Measuring All Oysters
1. **Complete Population Data**: No oysters are excluded from analysis
2. **Better Statistical Power**: Larger sample sizes for each tag
3. **Accurate Size Distributions**: Full range of sizes represented
4. **Population Health Assessment**: Can identify if there are many small/underdeveloped oysters
5. **Growth Pattern Analysis**: Better understanding of size variation within populations
